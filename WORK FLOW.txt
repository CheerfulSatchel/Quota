WORK FLOW:

Page 1) Textbox + submit button, put id of person into textbox
Page 2) Have a function to manually put purchases in (POST) 
		See purchases made in list view
		Set new budget, set time period 
		Display user info and shiz

Let users pick a recurring time period in the modal, which will be constantly recurring until it is reset later. 


Get current date, get date that budget is set for, and for all purchases within the time frame, compute the purchases within the time frame.
